Criteria:
Your program should ask the user for
* an initial debt
* the annual interest rate

* the program will state how long it will take for the debt to be repaid.
* extra: Calculate the total amount of interest that is paid along with the debt repayment

Sample:

The loan has an annual interest rate of .75% per month.  He makes monthly payments of $1000.
How many months will it take him to pay off the car.  How much interest has he paid in that time?

84 months
He will have paid 21711.60 in interest
